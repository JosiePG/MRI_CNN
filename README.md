# Summary
 Project exploring the underlying features of real Brain-Tumour MRI scans 
 
 
 Goal : Create a model that can accuractley identify a Meniginoma Tumour from a random MRI Scan image
 
 # Introduction
 
 In this Notebook, we will create a Convolutional-Neural_Network model using Tensorflow , Pandas , and Sklearn to accuratley identify a Meniginoma Tumour in the brain. We will also explore different ways to improve the model to ensure a consistently high accuracy model.
 
 # Motivation 
 Within the medicine industry, medical image analysis and illness detection play a vital role, especially in Non-invasive treatment. Medical imaging techniques and analysis tools help medical practitioners and radiologists to correctly diagnose the disease. Medical Image Processing has emerged as one of the most important tools to identify and diagnose various anomalies. Imaging enables doctors to visualize and analyze the MR images for finding the abnormalities in internal structures. An important factor in the diagnosis includes the medical image data obtained from various biomedical devices which use different imaging techniques like X-rays, CT scans, MRI, mammogram, etc.
