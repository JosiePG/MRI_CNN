# MRI_CNN


# Summary
 Project exploring the underlying features of real Brain-Tumor MRI scans 
 
 
 Goal : Create a model that can accuractley identify a Meniginoma Tumor from a random MRI Scan image
 
 # Introduction
 
 In this Notebook, we will create a Convolutional-Neural_Network model using Tensorflow , Pandas , and Sklearn to accuratley identify a Meniginoma Tumor in the brain. We will also explore different ways to improve the model to ensure a consistently high accuracy model.
